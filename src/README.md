## Original Proposal 
I won the family Texas Hold ‘Em game last year. While I was victorious, I know Aunt Nancy has been studying in preparation for this year’s game. I want to stay on top and practice some hands. I would like to build a Texas Hold Em’ game:

* Build infrastructure for game play
    * Deck
    * Players
    * Game Play
* Define a few common strategies for the AI (conservative, risky, balanced, etc.).
* Build a simple GUI in PyGame.
